# ReplicaLab

**A multi-agent scientific replication environment built on [OpenEnv](https://github.com/openenv)**

> *How do we adapt an experiment without breaking the science?*

ReplicaLab tackles the **replication crisis** in science. Published protocols describe ideal conditions, but real labs face missing equipment, tight budgets, booking conflicts, and reagent shortages. ReplicaLab trains an AI agent to negotiate realistic experiment adaptations while preserving scientific validity.

## How It Works

Each episode simulates a negotiation between two agents inside a constrained virtual lab:

| Role | Type | Responsibility |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Scientist** | Trainable LLM policy | Proposes replication protocols, preserves scientific rigor |
| **Lab Manager** | Rule-based policy | Enforces budget, equipment, staffing, and feasibility constraints |
| **Judge** | Deterministic rubric engine | Scores the final protocol on Rigor, Feasibility, and Fidelity |

### Episode Lifecycle

1. **Reset** -- `reset(seed)` generates a paper template, lab constraints, and a hidden evaluation rubric
2. **Scientist observes** -- Paper summary, experiment goal, conversation history, current protocol
3. **Lab Manager observes** -- Budget, equipment, calendar, reagents, staff, safety rules
4. **Negotiation** -- Multiple rounds of proposals, counteroffers, and questions
5. **Agreement or timeout** -- Both accept, or the round limit is reached
6. **Reward** -- Judge scores the final protocol

### Reward Formula

```
total_reward = 10 * rigor * feasibility * fidelity + efficiency_bonus + communication_bonus - penalties
```

The **multiplicative core** prevents fake wins: a scientifically perfect but impossible plan scores low, and a cheap but scientifically broken plan also scores low.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+ (for the frontend)
- Docker (for deployment)
- A Google Colab account (for RL training)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ayush10/replicalab-ai.git
cd replicalab-ai

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running the Environment Server

```bash
# Start the FastAPI + WebSocket server
python -m server.app
```

The server starts at `http://localhost:7860` by default.

### Running the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The React UI starts at `http://localhost:5173` and connects to the backend via WebSocket.

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Training the Scientist

RL training improves the Scientist agent's ability to negotiate effective, feasible protocols.

### Quick Start (Google Colab)

1. Open `notebooks/train_colab.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Connect to a GPU runtime
3. Run all cells -- the notebook handles environment setup, rollout, and training via TRL/Unsloth with GRPO

### Training Loop

```
Environment resets -> Scientist proposes -> Lab Manager responds -> ... -> Episode ends -> Reward computed -> Policy updated
```

**Target behaviors over training:**
- Ask better questions before committing to a protocol
- Preserve critical controls (positive/negative controls, minimum sample sizes)
- Choose realistic substitutions (e.g., WST1 instead of MTT when appropriate)
- Reach agreement in fewer rounds
- Avoid over-budget plans

---

## Scenario System

Scenarios are generated deterministically from a seed. Each template defines:

- Required equipment and valid substitutes
- Must-keep controls and minimum sample sizes
- Typical costs and likely bottlenecks
- Difficulty-scaled constraints

| Difficulty | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Easy** | Lab has most of what is needed |
| **Medium** | Some missing items, tighter budget and time |
| **Hard** | Major shortages, bigger tradeoffs, booking conflicts |

### Included Scenario Templates

| Template | Domain | Example Experiment |
|----------|--------|--------------------|
| `cell_biology` | Wet lab | Drug cytotoxicity assay (MTT/WST1) |
| `ml_benchmark` | Compute lab | Model evaluation with GPU/dataset constraints |
| `behavioral_psych` | Human subjects | Survey replication with participant pool limits |
